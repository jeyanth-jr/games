        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <p id="rules">
            <ol>
                <li>The game is played with one or more decks of 52 cards.</li>
                <li>The value of a hand is the sum of the point values of the individual cards. The point values of the cards are:
                    2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 are worth face value (i.e., 2 of clubs is worth two points).
                    face cards (jack, queen, and king) are worth 10 points.
                    Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on which value would be more beneficial for the hand.</li>
                <li>The player is dealt two cards and the dealer is dealt two cards, one face up and one face down (the hole card).</li>  
                <li>The player has the option to "hit" and receive additional cards in an attempt to get closer to 21 points, or "stand" and keep their current total. If the player goes over 21 points, they lose the game (this is called a "bust"). </li>
                <li>After the player has completed their turn, the dealer will reveal their hole card and hit or stand according to a predetermined set of rules. The dealer must hit if their total is less than 17 and stand if their total is 17 or higher.</li>
                <li>If the dealer goes over 21 points, the player wins the game. If the player's total is higher than the dealer's total, the player wins the game. If the dealer's total is higher than the player's total, the dealer wins the game. If the player and dealer have the same total, the game is a tie (this is called a "push").</li>
                <li>Some blackjack games offer the option to "surrender", which allows the player to forfeit the game and receive half their original bet back. This option is typically only offered at the start of the game, before the player takes any actions.</li>       
                <li>Some blackjack games also offer the option to "split" if the player is dealt two cards of the same value. This allows the player to split their cards into two separate hands and play them individually.</li>
